# API_Stackoverflow

Here, we will have the API for our project StackOverFlow.

I was using Heroku, but he becomes paid one, so i had to go to another one and i picked AWS for this API.

Unfortunately, i canceled the free one, so for now it's only the script without the view of the API.

About the script, 

I was using the regression logistics and i feed it with a BOW.

To be a bit more specific i choosed only the top 20 tags, i think i can go a bit more like 50-100 tags, but the score will be way reduce.
